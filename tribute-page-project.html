        <h3 id="headline"> Who is Kobe Bryant ?</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">Kobe Bean Bryant (August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional
          basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the
          National Basketball Association (NBA). Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Bryant won five
          NBA championships, and was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the
          All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP.</p>
        <p class="paragraphs">Born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy, Bryant was recognized as the top
          high-school basketball player in the U.S. while at Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania. The son of former
          NBA player Joe Bryant, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft after graduation, and was selected by the Charlotte
          Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a
          reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an
          All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three
          consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002.</p>
        <p class="paragraphs">After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the
          cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In 2006, he
          scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt
          Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010,
          and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through
          2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon at age 34. He subsequently suffered season-ending injuries to
          his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired
          after the 2015–16 season.</p>
        <p class="paragraphs">Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, due to
          blunt force trauma sustained from a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.A number of tributes and
          memorials were subsequently issued, including renaming the All-Star Game MVP Award in his honor.</p>
